Yes, those computationally expensive behemoths like Windows Visual Studios, running on my Intel Pentium 2GB RAM laptop as it huffed and puffed, barely managing to handle the program.  When I met VIM during my first internship, I fell in love and never turned back. <br> "

The written language has always been my favorite form of artistic expression.  I'll never forget the time I was told that "when language dies, the culture dies with it".  There is so much wisdom and emotion that can be captured through the written word, and I hope to use mine to share my life with all the other inhabitants of this curious world."
